        Things about me:
        <br>
        I am a really big fan of both history and math. Math helps me create things, like graphs, blueprints, floor plans and shapes that fit perfectly with one and another.
        History is also really neat because of all the interesting things that people have done with one and another in terms of leadership, advances in science, technology and philosiphy, and wars that people fought.
        <br>
        On my down time I like to play games, watch movies, snowboard and discuss/debate (in a civil manner) with people. My favorite movie is Fight Club and my favorite game series is Fallout.
